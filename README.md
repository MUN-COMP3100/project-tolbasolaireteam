### Proposal  
- A project description goes here. 
- Briefly elaborate on your conception of what the tool is for 
- As well as the user community needs or wants that you might address. 

### Project Feature Table

Fill the following table to list features that would be relevant to your concept of the project product. The column entries are as follows:

1. A short __name__ to refer to the feature
2. A brief __description__ of the feature in a sentence or less.
3. Which __end__ (server, client or both) is implicated in the coding needed. Try to break down features so they are primarily client-side (GUI, user interaction) or server-side (data manipulation, respond to user requests) where possible. Remember your server-side solution will be due first.
4. Do you plan to __deliver__  the feature as part of the project at the end of the course? (Yes, No or Maybe). _Maybe_ is for things you will try to deliver, but YES features will take precedence in terms of completing the project.
5. In the case of deliver=YES features, __who__ will be implementing the feature? One team member should be primarily responsible for the coding and delivery of the feature.

|Name|Description|End|Deliver|Who|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Login|User login and profiles|Server|Yes|Rakillo
|Drag|Drag and drop courses onto schedule|Client|Yes|starbaby23
|Grid|A primary grid display of weekly schedule|Client|Yes|Rakillo
|Google|Synchronize with google calendar|Server|Maybe||


- You must have at least 16 features in the Deliver=YES category, 
    - Within delivery=yes, eight feature for each of the Server and Client
         - Within each of server and client, four feature assigned to each team member

 - You should have another sixteen features in the Deliver=maybe or Deliver=no categories. These represent alternative or extra features that may be adopted if 
    - (a) you have time to complete more than the basic features 
    - (b) the marker feedback indicates that your plan is not ambitious enough, or 
    - (c) you need to adjust plans later on. 

### Description

You should elaborate on any of the features that are not self-explanatory, and particularly on Deliver=YES features so it is clear how extensive an implementation you anticipate. This will allow some idea of the coding effort involved. Use the feature names as sub-section headings to describe each feature. If you already know of a tool, module, library or express capability that will help your implementation you can include that information.
