### Proposal  
- A cooking website that allows users to manage their weekly grocery shopping and provides them with recipes cooking.
See **proposal.md** for more details.
This project has been approved by the instructor.
### Project Feature Table
- See **features.md** 

### Description

You should elaborate on any of the features that are not self-explanatory, and particularly on Deliver=YES features so it is clear how extensive an implementation you anticipate. This will allow some idea of the coding effort involved. Use the feature names as sub-section headings to describe each feature. If you already know of a tool, module, library or express capability that will help your implementation you can include that information.

### Setup (run these commands in the root directory of the project)
