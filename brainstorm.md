### Given 
- The mun course data from assignment 1. This project proposal would be an online student tool, for managing their course schedule.  You may get some ideas for features from the existing student tools at MUN, and think about additional features you would like to have, including integrations with other tools and other services.

- The IMDB movie datasets available at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. This proposal would be movie related, encompassing movie reviews, selection, and possibly integrating other features such as discussion chats or movie access or rental.  IMDB.com already has a wide range of online features available, so it would be most interesting to think of some project features they do not currently support.

### Other website ideas:
- Learning for educators and students
- Banking 
- Blogging 
- Photography  
- eCommerce 
- Youtube clone 
- A website that hosts ten's of thousands of recipes (I may have found a usable data set already) that allows you to randomly generate a weekly meal plan on user provided specifics, ie # of beef dishes, # of chicken dishes, etc in a week. Site will also provide a grocery list of items from the recipes. Maybe also genereate list of recipes with ingredients already on-hand. Will also provided printable recipes. If you can't tell, I really dislike doing meal plans because I am old and would love to be able to automate this task.
