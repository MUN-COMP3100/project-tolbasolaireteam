### Given 
- The mun course data from assignment 1. This project proposal would be an online student tool, for managing their course schedule.  You may get some ideas for features from the existing student tools at MUN, and think about additional features you would like to have, including integrations with other tools and other services.

- The IMDB movie datasets available at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/. This proposal would be movie related, encompassing movie reviews, selection, and possibly integrating other features such as discussion chats or movie access or rental.  IMDB.com already has a wide range of online features available, so it would be most interesting to think of some project features they do not currently support.

### Other website ideas:
    - Learning for educators and students
    - Banking 
    - Blogging 
    - Photography  
    - eCommerce 
    - Youtube clone
