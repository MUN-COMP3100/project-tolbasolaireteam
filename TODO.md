## TODO
### Explain how to run the project 
- [x] Do not remove the proposal documents or other elements of your first submission from the project repository
- [ ] Implement 6 server-side features
- [x] Provide steps needed to instantiate the database contents for your server implementation. 
- [x] Indicate in your README how the marker is to reconstitute your database to run your server-side solution. Some possibilities are:
    - provide source data files and instructions for the marker to recreate your database in their own local MongoDB server. This could involve mongoimport command usage for example.
    - provide a data dump (such as mongodump) and instructions for the marker to recreate your database in their own local MongoDB server (such as mongorestore).
    - provide the marker access to a remote database on a remote server where the database server is already installed and running.

### Implementation description 
- [x] Describe how to run and how to shut down your server. 
- [ ] Outline the basic architecture (code modules and module responsibilities) in your submission to help the marker understand your code.
