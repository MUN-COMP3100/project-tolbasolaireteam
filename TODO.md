## TODO
### Explain how to run the project 
- [x] Do not remove the proposal documents or other elements of your first submission from the project repository
- [ ] Implement 6 server-side features
- [ ] Provide steps needed to instantiate the database contents for your server implementation. 
- [ ] Indicate in your README how the marker is to reconstitute your database to run your server-side solution. Some possibilities are:
    - provide source data files and instructions for the marker to recreate your database in their own local MongoDB server. This could involve mongoimport command usage for example.
    - provide a data dump (such as mongodump) and instructions for the marker to recreate your database in their own local MongoDB server (such as mongorestore).
    - provide the marker access to a remote database on a remote server where the database server is already installed and running.

### Implementation description 
- [ ] Describe how to run and how to shut down your server. 
- [ ] Outline the basic architecture (code modules and module responsibilities) in your submission to help the marker understand your code.

### Feature Descriptions 

- [ ] For each feature implemented briefly describe the following:
    - name of the feature
    - A one or two sentence description of the feature. You may refer to (and possibly update) a section of the proposal for this component.
    - A brief description of the implementation strategy for the feature, including tools and imported packages and modules used
    - A statement of which other features or project modules (storage, etc) this feature uses or depends on.
    - A brief indication of the state of the implementation for the feature. Is it complete, how much is working?
    - A description of how to test the feature. Test code should be provided to test both working and failure modes of the feature from the client-side. Also indicate whether the test code is working properly and what the marker should see upon running the test code. You are encouraged to use a test framework (Mocha) for this part.
