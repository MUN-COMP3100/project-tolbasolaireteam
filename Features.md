|Feature name     |Description |Implementation strategy | Packages and modules |   Other feature(s) dependencies  | Implementation status |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--|
| Find recipe by ingredient | Allows users to search for recipes that contain a list of ingredients. | The function uses the `find()` method with a `$text` search on the Recipe collection to find recipes that contain all of the specified ingredients. The search results are sorted using the `$meta` operator with `textScore`. The feature limits the results to a maximum of 200 recipes and returns a message if there are no matches. The results are sorted by `textScore`, which is a MongoDB feature that ranks results by relevance.|MongoDB, JSON|This feature depends on the Recipe model and Mongo database.|Server side is fully implemented|
|Find recipe by type|This feature allows the user to search for recipes that match a given type of dish, such as beef, chicken, etc.|The implementation strategy involves searching the Recipe collection for recipes that match the dish. The search is based on a regular expression that matches any part of the ingredients field that contains the given type of dish. The search results are then returned as a JSON response.|MongoDB, JSON|This feature depends on the Recipe model and Mongo database.|Server side is fully implemented|
|Create new recipe |This feature allows users to create a new recipe and save it to the database. The user must provide a name, summary, ingredients, and directions for the recipe. Other optional fields include url, category, author, ratings, reviews, and nutrition information.|If all required fields are present, it creates a new recipe object in the database using the "create" method of the Recipe model. The updated recipe object is then saved to the database using the save() function. |MongoDB, JSON|This feature depends on the Recipe model and Mongo database.|Server side is fully implemented|
|Update recipe|This feature allows the user to update a recipe's ingredients or directions.|This feature uses the Mongoose package to find the recipe in the database and update the recipe object with new ingredient and direction values. The updated recipe object is then saved to the database using the save() function.|MongoDB, JSON|This feature depends on the Recipe model and Mongo database.|Server side is fully implemented|
|Delete recipe |This feature allows users to delete a recipe from the database by specifying the name of the recipe.|If the recipe name is present, the function uses the Mongoose findOne() method to find the recipe in the database based on its name. If the recipe is not found, a message indicating that there is no matching recipe is sent back to the user. If the recipe is found, the function uses the deleteOne() method to remove it from the database. Finally, a message confirming that the recipe has been deleted is sent back to the user.|MongoDB, JSON|This feature depends on the Recipe model and Mongo database.|Server side is fully implemented|
